title: Loading Data
---

Dynamically loading data from the server is why `getServerSideProps` was added to Next.js. We
build upon that to add a more rich feature set. But let start with the basics first.

The standard method that you might already be familiar with, looks something like thiss:

```js
export const getServerSideProps = async () => {
  return { props: { name: 'smeijer' } };
};
```

## handle » get

To make `next-runtime` handle this page route, simply wrap it with our `handle` util. By adding it on the page level,
we only process requests to those specific paths. All other pages are unaffected by your change.

```js
import { handle } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get() {
    return { props: { name: 'smeijer' } };
  },
});
```

That's it, your page works as before, except it also serves as `json` api for `GET` requests. We'll come back to that.

Just for convenience, we ship a `json` util that removes the need to wrap props in `props`. I mean, do we ever _not_ return props?

```js
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get() {
    return json({ name: 'smeijer' });
  },
});
```

How's that? As already briefly mentioned, by defining the handler inside our `handle` method, we not only serve the page component it's initial props, but this route now also supports json request. Give it a shot and request this same page with the browser, and curl or postman. Amazing, right?

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://example.com/page-path
# » { name: 'smeijer' }
```
