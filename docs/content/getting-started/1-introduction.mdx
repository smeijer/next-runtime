title: Introduction

Working with Next.js is a pleasure, but switching context between
[`api-routes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction),
[`static-site-generation`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation)
and
[`incremental-static-regeneration`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration)
is less than ideal. Next-runtime enables you to use
[`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering)
for all of it.

Get rid of the page props only limitation, and make it handle form submissions
as well. Complete with a free JSON api, without any additional work.

## Usage

In case you're not the documentation type of person, here's a quick example to
get you up and running. We'll go over it in the following pages, so no worries
if you don't get it right away.

To not confuse people that are unfamiliar with TypeScript, I'm not showing type
annotations. That being said, the project is fully annotated.

```jsx
import fs from 'fs';
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';
import { Form, usePendingFormSubmit } from 'next-runtime/form';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async upload({ file, stream }) {
    stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(`/uploads/${file.name}`));
  },

  async get({ params, query }) {
    return json({ name: 'Stephan Meijer' });
  },

  async post({ req: { body } }) {
    return json({ message: 'Thanks for your submission!' });
  },

  // patch, put, delete
});

export default function Home({ name, message }) {
  const pending = usePendingFormSubmit();

  if (message) {
    return <p>{message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <Form method="post" encType="multipart/form-data">
      <input name="name" defaultValue={name} />
      <input type="file" name="file" />
      <button type="submit">{pending ? 'submitting' : 'submit'}</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Credits

I've always been a big fan of simplicity, and reducing boilerplate. The YouTube
video
[CDN Caching, Static Site Generation, and Server Side Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLFHp7Sbkg)
by [Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence?lang=en) just clicked, and
has been an huge inspiration for this project. You can clearly see my attempt to
bring a bit of the simplicity that Remix offers to Next.js. Some functions have
their signature all over it, because my goal is to have a Remix-like
API/philosophy in Next for those that are unable to switch. Credit where
credit's due. <span class="text-red-600">❤</span>️ [Remix](https://remix.run),
