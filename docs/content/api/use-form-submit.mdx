title: useFormSubmit
---

A hook that provides access to the state and data of Forms on the page. This
hook is a companion for [`Form`](/api/form) and allows you to create fancy
loading screens.

```jsx
import { useFormSubmit } from 'next-runtime/form';

function MyPage() {
  const form = useFormSubmit('create-user');

  if (form.isLoading) {
    return <p>{`Currently submitting ${form.values.name}`}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <Form method="post" name="create-user">
      <input name="name" />
      <button type="submit">submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Options

`useFormSubmit` takes the following options:

- **name** _string_

  The name of the form to connect to. As form names are optional, so is this
  option. That being said, we strongly recommend you to provide a name, as
  unnamed forms might cause issues in later stages of your project.

## Returns

`useFormSubmit` returns an object holding the following properties:

- **status** _string_

  The status of this form. It will be one of the following options, and defaults
  to `idle`.

  - `idle`: if the form is at rest and hasn't yet been submitted.
  - `submitting`: the form is submitted, and waiting for response from the
    server. Form values are available under `values` and `formData`.
  - `routing`: the server returned a `redirect`, we're now rerouting the client.
  - `error`: the submission resulted in an error. Error details are stored under
    `error`.
  - `success`: the submission has been completed, and we got a response code in
    the 200 range, or have been redirected. Response data is stored under
    `data`.

- **data**: _Record<string, unknown>_

  The response data returned in case of a successful submission.

- **error** _FetchError | Error_

  In case of client side errors, this holds the standard `Error` type, with a
  name and message. In case of server-side errors, a `FetchError` is available.
  A `FetchError` extends the default `Error` class with the following
  properties:

  - `message` _string_- the error status code and message formatted as
    `[status]: message`
  - `status` _number_- the response status code
  - `statusText` _string_- the response status text
  - `headers` _Headers_- the response headers
  - `data` _Record<string, unknown>_- the response data

- **formData** _FormData_

  The form values that the user is submitting, provided as `FormData`.

- **values** _Record<string, unknown>_

  The form values that the user is submitting, provided in
  [expanded form](/api/handle-requests#query-expansion).

- **isIdle** _Boolean_

  A boolean status prop derived as `status === 'idle'`

- **isSubmitting** _Boolean_

  A boolean status prop derived as `status === 'submitting'`

- **isRouting** _Boolean_

  A boolean status prop derived as `status === 'routing'`

- **isLoading** _Boolean_

  A boolean status prop derived as `status === 'loading' || status === 'routing`

- **isSuccess** _Boolean_

  A boolean status prop derived as `status === 'success`

- **isError** _Boolean_

  A boolean status prop derived as `status === 'error'`
