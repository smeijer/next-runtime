title: Middleware
---

next-runtime has supports for middlewares. Middlewares are applied using the
onion model, which allows you to wrap the request handlers. When returning
response objects from the middlewares, the results will be merged with the
return value from the request handler. Allowing you to extract utils that for
example return props for shared layout components.

## use

This is where your middlewares go, add as many functions as you like.

```js
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  use: [
    ({ req }) => {
      return json({ layout: 'props ' });
    },
  ],

  async get() {
    return json({ page: 'content' });
  },
});
```

**Arguments**

Middlewares get two arguments, `context` and `next`.

- **context** _RuntimeContext_

  The `context` parameter is the object as provided by Next.js
  [`GetServerSidePropsContext`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering)
  extended with [cookie](/api/cookies) and [header](/api/headers) handlers.

- **next** _() => void_

  A callback which is optional, but must be called when defined. It's used to
  signal next-runtime when the next middleware should be run.

**Returns**

Middlewares should either return nothing, or one of the response helpers.

- [**notFound**](/api/response-helpers#notfound)

  A notFound response has the highest priority and is final. Because 404s are
  often used to hide content for unauthorized access, there is no way around
  this.

  Do note that the remaining stack is still executed. If that's not what you
  want, the `notFound` [should be thrown](/api/response-throwing) instead.

- [**redirect**](/api/response-helpers#redirect)

  The redirect has the second-highest priority. The first redirect that's being
  returned, is the one that will be sent as response.

  Do note that the remaining stack is still executed. If that's not what you
  want, the `notFound` [should be thrown](/api/response-throwing) instead.

- [**json**](/api/response-helpers#json)

  Json responses have a special behavior when returned from middlewares. They're
  being merged! Meaning, all data and all headers that you'll return, will be
  brought together on the response.

  The json body is merged shallow, we don't do deep merging. Json responses can
  be thrown as well, but they probably make the most sense as layout helpers. To
  return partial data sets for the page, which are the same across various
  pages.

## Recipes

### Cors

It's no problem to use express middleware like the `cors` package. All you need
to do, is map the next-style signature to an express-style signature.

```js
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';
import Cors from 'cors';

const cors = Cors({ methods: ['GET', 'HEAD'] });

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  use: [(context, next) => cors(context.req, context.res, next)],

  async get() {
    return json({});
  },
});
```

### Request times

Handlers can be wrapped using the `next` callback, for example to add error
handling logic, or to time requests/response times.

Whenever a user hits the route as defined below, a special `x-request-time`
header is added to the response, telling you how long the request took.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

const responseTime: MiddlewareFn = async ({ res }, next) => {
  const start = performance.now();
  await next();
  const duration = performance.now() - start;
  res.setHeader('x-request-time', `${duration.toFixed(2)} ms`);
};

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  use: [responseTime],

  async get() {
    return json();
  },
});
```

### Shared / common props

Sometimes you have this repeating set of props, that are the same for every
page. How awesome would it be if _that_ could be abstracted away trough
middlewares?!

Simply use the json response helper to return data from your middleware. Json
responses will be merged, so the page below would receive
`{ propOne: 1, propTwo: 2 }`.

```ts
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  use: [
    () => {
      return json({ propOne: 1 });
    },
  ],

  async get() {
    return json({ propTwo: 2 });
  },
});
```
