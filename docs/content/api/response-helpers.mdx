title: Response Helpers
---

next-runtime includes a few convenient helpers to increase the readability of
your return statements. Usage is recommended, but entirely optional.

## json

Returns the provided data as response in case of JSON api requests. For standard
HTML requests, the prop are wrapped with `{ props: { ... } }` and handed over to
Next.js.

```js
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get() {
    // { props: { hello: 'world' } }
    return json({ hello: 'world' }, options);
  },
});
```

**Options**

As second argument a status code, or response initialization object can be
provided.

- **statusCode** _json(data, statusCode)_

  If you just need a status code other than 200, you might want to call it like
  `json(data, number)`. In that case, the statusCode will be applied to the
  response stream.

- **ResponseInit** _json(data, ResponseInit)_

  Use this if you need more control over the response. For example if you need a
  custom `statusText` or need to send additional headers. See
  [response options](#response-options) for more.

## redirect

In case of JSON api requests, `redirect` sets the location header to forward the
requests. For standard HTML requests, the input is mapped to the
`{ redirect: { destination } }` format and handed over to Next.js.

```js
import { handle, redirect } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get() {
    // { redirect: { destination: '/other-page', permanent: false } }
    return redirect('/other-page', options);
  },
});
```

**Options**

As second argument, a status code, next-like options, or response initialization
object can be provided. The options are optional, and the redirect defaults to a
temporary redirect (status: 302).

- **statusCode** _redirect(data, statusCode)_

  If you prefer specifying the status code like `301` or `302`, you might want
  to call it like `redirect('/destination', number)`. In that case, the
  statusCode will be applied to the response stream.

- **options** _redirect(destination, { permanent: boolean })_

  A more next-like signature. Specify `{ permanent: true }` to mark it as a
  permanent redirect, or `{ permanent: false }` to mark the redirect as
  temporary.

- **ResponseInit** _json(data, ResponseInit)_

  Use this if you need more control over the response. For example if you need a
  custom `statusText` or need to send additional headers. See
  [response options](#response-options) for more.

## notFound

Return this statement when you want to show the user that this page doesn't
exist. Either because it really doesn't, or they shouldn't know it does because
they lack permissions.

```js
import { handle, notFound } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get() {
    // { notFound: true }
    return notFound(options);
  },
});
```

**Options**

As first argument, a status code, or response initialization object can be
provided. The options are optional, and the statusCode defaults to 404.

- **statusCode** _notFound(statusCode)_

  If you need a more specific (sub) status, you might want to call it like
  `notFound(number)`. In that case, the statusCode will be applied to the
  response stream.

- **ResponseInit** _notFound(ResponseInit)_

  Use this if you need more control over the response. For example if you need a
  custom `statusText` or need to send additional headers. See
  [response options](#response-options) for more.

## Response Options

Every response helper accepts `ResponseInit` as optional argument.
`ResponseInit` is based on the
[`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)
interface of the `Fetch API`

The following options are supported:

- **status** _number_

  The status code of the response. (e.g., `200` for a success, and `401` for
  unauthorized).

- **statusText** _string_

  The status message corresponding to the status code. (e.g., `OK` for `200`);

- **headers** _Headers | { [key: string]: string }_

  Any headers that you want to add to your response, contained within a Headers
  object, or object literal of string key/value pairs.

**Example**

```js
import { handle, json } from 'next-runtime';

export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get() {
    return json(
      { hello: 'world' },
      {
        status: 200,
        statusText: 'OK',
        headers: {
          'x-server-time': Date.now(),
        },
      },
    );
  },
});
```

## Common mistakes

These response helpers return an extended object based on the
[`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response)
object. Thereby, they won't function with standard `getServerSideProps`
functions. If you're getting a serialization error, or additional keys error,
like below, then you're probably using these out of the context of
`next-runtime/handle`.

```bash
Server Error
Error: Error serializing props returned from `getServerSideProps` in "...".
Reason: Props must be returned as a plain object from getServerSideProps: `{ props: { ... } }` (received: `[object Undefined]`).
```

```bash
Server Error
Error: Additional keys were returned from `getServerSideProps`. Properties intended for your component must be nested under the `props` key, e.g.:
```
