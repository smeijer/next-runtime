title: Form Component
---

The `Form` component can be used to upgrade your HTML `<form>`. Note that it
posts the form data to the current page path, so it's meant to be use in
conjunction with `handle` to process post data in `getServerSideProps`.

It does not do any client side state management. It's as much as an alternative
to full fletched form libs, as it is not.

The philosophy of `next-runtime` is to do more on the server, and less on the
client. Simpler form handling is part of that.

When using `Form`, we recommend to use `defaultValue` to set initial values, and
to not use `value` or `onChange` handlers. Read
"[simple form handling in react](https://dev.to/smeijer/simple-form-handling-in-react-o72)"
to read more about that approach.

```jsx
import { Form } from 'next-runtime/form';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <input name="name" defaultValue={name} />
      <input name="country" defaultValue={country} />
      <button type="submit">submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Props

`Form` takes the following props. All props are optional.

- **method** _get | post_

  The method to use for form submissions. `get` appends the form-data to the URL
  in name/value pairs, while `post` sends the form-data as an HTTP post
  transaction. Defaults to `post`

- **onSubmit** _(event: FormEvent) => void_

  A callback that's invoked before form submission. It receives the raw `event`
  as argument from React. This function can be used for validation. Call
  `event.preventDefault` to block our handler from being fired.

- **onSuccess** _(response: Record<string, unknown>) => void_

  A callback that's invoked upon successful submission. Can be used to update
  the page or invoke a redirect. `response` the json payload returned from the
  `post` handler.

- **onError** _(error: { code: string | number, message: string, { [key:
  string]: unknown }) => void_

  A callback that's invoked when the form errors on the server side. Can be used
  to show an error message.

  If the error originates from the server, code will default to
  `response.status`, and message to `response.statusText`. The error object gets
  merged with the json returned from the server. So the defaults can be
  overwritten.

  If the error originates from the client, code will be `Error.name`, and
  message the `Error.message`.

- **shallow** _boolean_

  Submit the form without updating the current page. The form will still be
  reset, but the `get` handler is not rerun. Defaults to `false`.

## usePendingFormSubmit

A hook that provides access to the data that is currently being submitted. This
allows you to create fancy loading screens.

```jsx
import { usePendingFormSubmit } from 'next-runtime/form';

function MyPage() {
  const pending = usePendingFormSubmit();

  if (pending) {
    return <p>{`Currently submitting ${pending.data.get('name')}`}</p>;
  }

  // ...
}
```
