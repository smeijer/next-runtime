title: Response Throwing
---

Responses can be returned, but they can also be thrown. This enables us to break
out of the response pipeline, without creating a _pyramid of death_ or tons of
_if not, return_ statements.

## Example

Imagine a `/me` route. A `get` handler that checks if the user is authenticated,
and returns the user object if that's the case.

Something like:

```js
export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get({ req }) {
    if (!req.user) {
      return redirect('/login');
    }

    return json({ user: req.user });
  },
});
```

That works, but for more complex handlers, the if statements might become
tedious. Besides, the logic isn't easily reusable across various api handlers.
Response throwing enables us to reuse checks, while flattening the flow.

First, we'll extract the assertion to a reusable helper:

```js
import { redirect } from 'next-runtime';

function assertIsAuthenticated(request) {
  if (!user.request) {
    throw redirect('/login', 303);
  }
}
```

And now we can use that assertion function across our api handlers:

```ts
export const getServerSideProps = handle({
  async get({ req }) {
    assertIsAuthenticated(req);
    return json({ user: req.user });
  },
});
```

Because our assertion throws, instead of returns, we don't need another check.
If the user is not logged in, a redirect response is being sent to the client.
If there is a `req.user` object, the assertion will pass and the json result is
returned.

## Typescript

We can decorate the assertion with
[typescript assertions](https://dev.to/smeijer/typescript-type-assertions-4klf)
to get the most benefit out of it. Using assertions like below, `req.user` is
`undefined` before the assertion, while it's `User` after
`assertIsAuthenticated`.

```ts
import { redirect } from 'next-runtime';

function assertIsAuthenticated<T>(
  request: T,
): asserts request is T & { user: User } {
  if (!('user' in request)) {
    throw redirect('/login', 303);
  }
}
```
